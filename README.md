# Project Instructions

Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT!

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

# Project Summary

> Before the final submission date you should include a "PROJECT SUMMARY" in this section here.

- A description of how you want to present the project to the world
  I made kind of a basic program. However, this program will test your short-term memory in a fun way. The memory cards are of something I love either playing or watching. I hope whoever plays it will enjoy it.

- A reflection of the experiences you had while creating the project
  When I first started making the program I almost thought it would be to easy. However when I first built the design, I got stuck. There are many small pieces that have to be right and there was alot of trial and error to get things to work properly. I tried time and time again to find information online of my problems, however since all code is relative to what is written before it was hard navigating through the information. But I learned that if you keep trying to solve the problem youÂ¨ll think of more and more ideas, and trials become successes. Also just speaking openly about the problems with Colin helped, it opened my mind abit for ideas.
  Overall I have good experiences. It was my first project where I started from scratch and I learned alot about how loops and function can be used in real practice.

- A list of what could be improved on the program if you had more time?
- Id find a way to localy store highscores so that everyone can save their score in their browser. I know there is a way.
- Id fix the clicking to fast bug

A conclusion on the budget. Did you manage to stick to the budget? Why? / Why not?
Not really. The first steps, design and overall basic function of the game did not take long to figure out. I also did mini-work whenever I had free time at that point.
The most amount of time I spent on the program was when It almost was finnished. I took me alot of braincells to figure out how to shuffle the cards properly and also at the same time use what I coded before regarding the matching of cards.

# User Guide

The game is a memory game. There are 5 pairs behind the questionmarked cards. The goal is to find all the matching pairs.
When the first card is clicked the timer will automatically start and the card turns, the user can now click another card and that card also turns. If the cards match, the cards will lock with faces up. If the cards do not match, the cards will turn again and the game continues. When all matches are found, your final time will present itself and you get the option to play again.
